**Bird Species Observation Analysis in Forest and Grassland Ecosystem**

In this project, I worked with bird observation data collected in Excel, focusing on forest and grassland areas. The main goal was to understand which bird species analysis done by the observer.

I started by cleaning and organizing the data to fix any mistakes or missing values. Then I did basic data analysis to explore patternsâ€”like which species were most common, or how bird sightings changed over time or by location.

To show the results clearly, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn (Python tools) to make charts and graphs. I also created an interactive dashboard in Power BI, so users can easily explore the data and gain insights.

This project helped turn raw birdwatching data into useful information that can support wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts.
